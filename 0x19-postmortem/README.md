My First Postmortem

Issue Summary

Duration of the Outage:
2024-06-01 14:00 UTC to 2024-06-01 16:30 UTC

Impact:
The primary web service was down, affecting approximately 90% of users with complete inaccessibility, while 10% experienced significant slowdowns

Root Cause:
A misconfiguration in the load balancer routed all traffic to a single server, causing it to become overwhelmed and fail.

Timeline
 * 14:00 UTC - Issue detected through a monitoring alert indicating a spike in server errors.
 * 14:05 UTC - On-call engineer receives alert and begins investigation.
 * 14:10 UTC - Initial assumption of recent code deployement issue; deployement rollback initiated.
 * 14:20 UTC - Rolled back deployement but issue persisted.
 * 14:30 UTC - Escalated to the network team to check for infrastructure issues.
 * 14:45 UTC - Network team identifies misconfiguration in the load balancer.
 * 15:00 UTC - Misleading path: suspected database issue due to high read/write requests.
 * 15:30 UTC - Correctly identified load balancer routing issue.
 * 16:00 UTC - Reconfigured load balancer to properly distribute traffic.
 * 16:30 UTC - Services fully restored and confirmed operational.

Root Cause and Resolution

Root Cause:
The load balancer configuration file was changed during a maintenance window, causing all traffic to route to a single server. This server quickly became overwhelmed, leading to the outage.

Resolution:
The load balancer configuration was corrected to distribute traffic among all servers. The updated configuration was tested in a staging environment before being deployed to production. An automated configuration validation tool was implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.

Corrective and Preventative Measures

Improvements and Fixes:

 1. Review and Update Maintenance Procedures: Ensure all changes, especially those related to critical infrastructure, are reviewed by multiple team members.

 2. Implement Automated Configuration Validation: Use tools to automatically check for common misconfigurations before changes are applied.

 3. Enhance Monitoring and Alerts: Improve monitoring to quickly detect load imbalances and other critical issues.

 4. Increase Load Balancer Redundancy: Configure multiple load balancers to avoid single points of failure.

TODO List:

 1. Patch the load balancer configuration to prevent similar issues.

 2. Add detailed monitoring for load balancer traffic distribution.

 3. Conduct training sessions for the team on best practices for configuration management.

 4. Implement an automated rollback mechanism for infrastructure changes.

 5. Review and enhance incident response procedures to reduce detection and resolution times.
